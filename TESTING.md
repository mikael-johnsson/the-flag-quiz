## BUGS
The site has encountered a few bugs, displayed in a list below:
- compareAnswer function not working
- Clicking on buttons on tablet/mobile gave remaining hover function
- No answer message displaying at last question

### Solved Bugs
#### compareAnswer bug
The compareAnswer function (paired with the way to create it's arguments) were supposed to compare the users selected answer to the correct answer. It did not work.

![Screenshot of the compareAnswer bug on the site](assets/images/readme/bug_compareAnswer_1.png)

![Screenshot of the faulty compareAnswer code](assets/images/readme/bug_compareAnswer_2.png)

After enough testing, a different code solution was found on Stack Overflow, created by the user *dfsq*.

#### Hover function on tablets/mobile
All the buttons on the site gives a visual cue when hovering them with the mouse. When using a tablet or mobile, that function instead gave the cue after the button had been clicked, and stayed there. This created the problem that one option button at the next question still had the que.

The function was removed in the media querie for tablets and mobile.

### Unsolved bugs
#### No final answer message
Unfortunately the code, at the moment, does not allow the answer message to display after the final question, as the end message appears instead. The user can still see if the answer was correct by looking at the score before and after answering the question.
